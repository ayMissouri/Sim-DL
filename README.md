# Lets get started!

### Step 1: Unlocking the DLC
1. Extract the DLC Unlocker files into a folder. (To extract use [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0))
2. Run the `setup.bat` or `setup` file.

4. Wait for the terminal to open and detect EA or Origin launcher.

   _Yours will not say `DLC Unlocker installed` and `Game configs installed: The Sims 4` yet!_
6. Type `1` and then press enter into the terminal install the unlocker.
7. After that is done press `2` and enter, this will display a list of games.
8. In our case we will be doing Sims 4 which should be option `21` so type that and press enter.
9. After that is done you can now quit the unlocker by typing `q` and pressing enter.

### Step 2: Providing the content to the game
1. Open the `dlc` folder.
2. Open your game folder. (For steam right click the game, hover over manage, then press Browse Local Files)

4. Drag ALL the folders from the `dlc.zip` folder into your game folder. (This may take some time since there is a lot of DLC. Mine took around 3 and a half minutes)

   _Your game folder should look something like this_


### Step 3: ENJOY!
The next time you launch the game you will be notified that you have all the DLC and should see it in the packs tab.

_Note: their system of showing the dlc is really annoying but you can hold ESC to skip past the welcomes faster_
