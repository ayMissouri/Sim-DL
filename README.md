# Lets get started!

### Step 1: Unlocking the DLC
1. Extract the DLC Unlocker files into a folder. (To extract use [7z](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0))
2. Run the `setup.bat` or `setup` file.
3. Wait for the terminal to open and detect EA or Origin launcher.
4. Type `1` and then press enter into the terminal install the unlocker.
5. After that is done press `2` and enter, this will display a list of games.
6. In our case we will be doing Sims 4 which should be option `21` so type that and press enter.
7. After that is done you can now quit the unlocker by typing `q` and pressing enter.

### Step 2: Providing the content to the game
1. Open the `dlc` folder.
2. Open your game folder. (For steam right click the game, hover over manage, then press Browse Local Files)
3. Drag ALL the folders from the `dlc.zip` folder into your game folder. (This may take some time since there is a lot of DLC. Mine took around 3 and a half minutes)
